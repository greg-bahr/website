Hi, I'm a 19 year old Computer Science student from St. Louis, MO. I love to learn by being hands-on, so I have a bunch of projects that I work on from time to time. I have a variety of interests and hobbies that include:

- robotics 
- computer vision 
- web development
- electronics
- drones

They are a lot of fun and very rewarding, so hopefully I get around to writing about them someday. Thanks for checking my website.
